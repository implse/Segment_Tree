# Segment Tree

A Segment Tree is a data structure that allows answering range queries over an array effectively, while still being flexible enough to allow modifying the array. This includes finding the `sum` of consecutive array elements `a[lâ€¦r]`, or finding the `minimum` or `maximum` element in a such a range in `O(log n)` time.
